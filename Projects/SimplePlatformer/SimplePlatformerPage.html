                <p>"Simple Platformer" is the first mobile game I built for publishing. The idea of this game is to get more experience with planning, developement and publishing mobile games.
                    <br><br>Although I wanted to publish the game, it served as a big learning area as developing a game from the begin and making sure how each components work together, proved to be quite a big challenge.
                    <br><br>While developing this game, one of the biggest things I learned and started to appreciate is the planning progress. When I first started to develop game, I used to skipped the planning and dive straight into the developement
                    and I would normally get stuck or have to go back several steps and change things.
                    <br><br>With this game however, I decided to put more emphasis on the planning process. It took much longer than I hoped but it made the development stage so much easier and I didn't have to go back and change things as all these issues
                    were tackled in the planning and solved.
