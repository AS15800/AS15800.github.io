                <p>The Islamic Society will be taking part of the "Welcome Fair" on the 22nd September at the Greenwich Campus. 
                    We offer two types of membership, a free version and a paid version. 
                    The paid membership helps us to provide better activities. 
                    You can sign up to the Isoc on the day by providing your name, phone number, Student ID and email address. 
                    You can also sign up to the Isoc online via the Student Union's website.
                    Every Isoc member will receive a virtual Freshers Pack.</p>
