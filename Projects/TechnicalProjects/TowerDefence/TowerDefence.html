                <p>A lightweight application (under 5 MB) that shows how to pray according to the Qur’an 
                    and Authentic Hadith. It is built by reverts who went through the challenges of learning 
                    to pray to enable people to learn to pray quickly.

                <p>As this application is free, we want to make sure it is available to as many people as 
                    possible. We also don’t have any ads as we can’t have full control over the ads that 
                    are shown. To continue updating, maintaining and  supporting our mission to teach Islam, 
                    we require support, telling people about the app and financial support. We have opened a 
                    patreon page where people are able to donate and support our mission.
